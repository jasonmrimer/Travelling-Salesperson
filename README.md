## Usage
I designed this application with `Chrome` users in mind. While the site itself guides you through its use, keep in mind that it does not take file uploadsâ€“-you must copy/paste your city coordinates from the TSP text files. Here is what you can expect to see when the application runs properly.

*Beware: 12-city routes take nearly 2 minutes to calculate on a machine with 32GB of memory.
